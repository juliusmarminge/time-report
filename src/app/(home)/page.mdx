## Features

Time Report aims to be as simple as possible, the main features we aim to solve are:

### Easily report time for multiple clients

 Most existing apps are made for companies with lots of employees that
reports their time for a single company. Time Report takes a different
stance and focuses on contractors that invoice multiple companies.


### Tracking your month

Easily keep track of how many hours you've worked for each of your
clients, and how much you'll end up invoicing them at the end of the
period. You'll also get aggregate information for all your differnet
clients in a single place.



### Automatic currency converting.

Invoicing clients in different currencies? No worries, set your
preferred currency and we'll convert the total to that currency.

## How to use?

Time Report has 3 main concepts, **Clients**, **Periods** and **Slots**.

### Clients

Clients are... well your clients that you report time for. When
creating clients you'll provide the currency that you invoice them in,
your default hourly rate as well as what billing period you use for
that client. For example, you may invoice a client $100 USD per hour
and send them an invoice every month.


### Periods

Periods corresponds to the billing period that you use for a client.
For the above example, you'll have a period for each month. At the end
of the month, you'll get notified to close that period and create a
new one so that you can easily keep track of what you have invoiced
and not.


### Slots

Each period gets filled with a bunch of Slots. Slots are time entries
with a duration, currency and amount (which defaults to your default
hourly rate for that client). You can add as many slots as you want to
a period and Time Report will calculate the total amount for you.
